This theme is included as an example: it's a variant of the WordPress
default theme, which itself is based upon Kubrick.

The theme CSS and image files are lifted straight from WordPress itself,
and so are licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

The PHP files were written for Eregansu, but designed to match the output
of WordPress. As far as I'm concerned they can be released into the public
domain, but they may be considered a derivative of the WordPress equivalents
and so covered by the terms of the GNU General Public License also.
